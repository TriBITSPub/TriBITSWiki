TriBITS from a clone on the machine casl-dev.ornl.gov is tested in continuous integration testing and nightly testing along with the CASL VERA project which has a [private CDash dashboard](https://casl-dev.ornl.gov/cdash/index.php?project=VERA&subproject=TriBITS).  This is because CASL funds the majority of TriBITS development and this testing directly supports that project.

The github version is currently being tested at using the [Travis CI TriBITS build](https://travis-ci.org/TriBITSPub/TriBITS).  In the near future, independent CTest/CDash driver builds against the github.com 'master' branch will be set up that submit results to:
