  - Anyone can join and get emails when a new post is submitted
  - Users can help each other answer questions
  - The [list archives](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/tribits-users) is publicly view-able and is publicly searchable
* `tribits-developers`
  - Used for developers (and power users) of TriBITS to discuss topics and communicate with each other
  - Anyone can submit emails to the list but only members to the list can read the archives.
* `tribits-checkins`
  - Used by the TriBITS `checkin-test.py` script to log and archive info about pushes
  - Anyone can post to the list (so that it is easy to sent using `mailx` from the checkin-test.py script from different machines).
  - Only members of the list can view the contents of the list
