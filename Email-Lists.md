###  Google Groups Email Lists

TriBITS has the following email lists on Google Groups (i.e. `<list-name>@googlegroups.com`):
* `tribits-users`
  - Allows anyone to post questions about the usage of TriBITS
  - Anyone can join and get emails when a new post is submitted
  - Users can help each other answer questions
  - The [list archives](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/tribits-users) is publicly view-able and is publicly searchable
* `tribits-developers`
  - Used for developers (and power users) of TriBITS to discuss topics and communicate with each other
  - Anyone can submit emails to the list but only members to the list can read the archives.
* `tribits-checkins`
  - Used by the TriBITS `checkin-test.py` script to log and archive info about pushes to TriBITS itself.
  - Anyone can post to the list (so that it is easy to sent using `mailx` from the checkin-test.py script from different machines).
  - Only members of the list can view the contents of the list

### Subscribing to a list

To request to subscribe to one of the above Google Group email lists, perform the following procedure:

1. Send email to `<mail-list>+subscribe@googlegroups.com` from the email account that you want to receive the list emails from.

2. When a confirmation email is sent back, simply reply to the email (do **not** click "Join this Group").

3. Send an email to `tribits-developers@googlegroups.com` stating that you sent a subscription request to become a member and provide a short justification for why you should be added as a member to the list (NOTE: This is needed because Google Groups will not send a notification email to the list owner).

4. The list owner (who is a member of `tribits-developers`) will review the request and, if approved, will finalize the subscription (This is listed under "Members"->"Join Requests").

5. An email is sent stating that your request was approved and you are now subscribed.

**WARNING:** If the email account that you send the subscription request from is associated with you Google GMail account in any way (e.g. as a backup email address), then the list emails may go to your GMail account and not the email account to tried to subscribe from!
