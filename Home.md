# TriBITS GitHub Site Info

This GitHub site uses a simple [Kanban process for Issue Tracking](https://github.com/TriBITSPub/TriBITS/wiki/Kanban-Process-for-Issue-Tracking).  Both new features and bugs should be submitted as new GitHub Issues.

TriBITS has a few [email lists](https://github.com/TriBITSPub/TriBITS/wiki/Email-Lists) to enable communication between TriBITS users and developers (and to log and archive test/push actions).

There is [CI testing](https://travis-ci.org/TriBITSPub/TriBITS) set up using a Travis-CI Service.

TriBITS is subjected to continuous integration (CI) and nightly testing with a [TriBITS CDash Dashboard](https://github.com/TriBITSPub/TriBITS/wiki/TriBITS-CDash-Dashboard).

See [Contributing to TriBITS](https://github.com/TriBITSPub/TriBITS/wiki/Contributing-to-TriBITS) for requirements and the recommended process for making changes to TriBITS.
