# TriBITS GitHub Site Info

General TriBITS build, user, and maintainers guides can be found on the [TriBITS GitHub Pages Site](https://tribitspub.github.io/TriBITS/) and on [tribits.org](https://tribits.org).

This GitHub site uses a simple [Kanban process for Issue Tracking](https://github.com/TriBITSPub/TriBITS/wiki/Kanban-Process-for-Issue-Tracking).  Both new features and bugs should be submitted as new GitHub Issues.

TriBITS has a few [email lists](https://github.com/TriBITSPub/TriBITS/wiki/Email-Lists) to enable communication between TriBITS users and developers (and to log and archive test/push actions).

There is [automated testing](https://github.com/TriBITSPub/TriBITS/actions) set up using GitHub Actions.  TriBITS pull requests against 'master' are tested as are all pushes to 'master' and every day a set of nightly builds runs (to ensure the testing infrastructure continues to keep working).  All of these build and test results are submitted to the [TriBITS CDash Dashboard](https://github.com/TriBITSPub/TriBITS/wiki/TriBITS-CDash-Dashboard).

See [Contributing to TriBITS](https://github.com/TriBITSPub/TriBITS/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) for requirements and the recommended process for making changes to TriBITS.
